Manuscript title: "Machine learning prediction of ore deposit genesis using magnetite geochemistry".
Author: Peng Zhang, Zhen-Jie Zhang, Jie Yang, and Qiu-Ming Cheng.
Program name: MLP Classifier, RF classifier, SVM classifier.

Instruction guide
This article provides the codes of three classifiers, each of which is divided into two parts. The first half builds the classifier based on "Supplementary Table 2.xlsx", so in oder to make the codes run properly, do not make any changes on "Supplementary Table 2.xlsx" and "clr".

In the second half, readers can import their own excel data to use the classifier making new predictions. Need python environment and pandas and scikit-learn Libraris.
